Vermessr from German Vermesser (/fɛɐ̯ˈmɛsɐ/) helps you read the data from crappy images of crappy diagrams.

Example workflow for line charts:
1. Drag and drop the image onto the designated area.
2. Set the scale of the x- and y-axis.
3. Resize the overlay with the pink outline so that it fits the diagram's data area. Pro tip: hold down the `Shift`-key to activate resizing.
4. Set a vertical ruler which shows you where a value on the x-axis is located.
5. Spot where the vertical ruler intersects the line.

You can also watch the [demo video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janKollars/vermessr/main/public/vermessr-demo.mp4) where I apply the steps on an example diagram.
